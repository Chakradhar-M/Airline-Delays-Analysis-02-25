### 📌 Background  

Flight delays pose a major challenge to the aviation industry, impacting not only airlines but also airports, service providers, and time-sensitive sectors like logistics and tourism. Delays lead to congestion, inefficient air traffic flow, increased fuel consumption, and heightened carbon emissions, making their mitigation both an operational and environmental priority.

With a wide range of contributing factors, including weather disruptions, air traffic congestion, mechanical issues, and scheduling inefficiencies, it becomes essential to analyze data to detect delay patterns and improve flight punctuality. Data-driven insights can empower stakeholders to enhance operational efficiency and passenger satisfaction while reducing costs and environmental impact.

### 🎯 Objective  

The objective of this project is to create a comprehensive and interactive dashboard that examines flight delay patterns across various dimensions, including:  
✔️ Delay trends by airport, airline, and time of year  
✔️ Identification of the busiest airports and months  
✔️ Analysis of primary causes of delays  
✔️ Comparison of on-time performance among airlines and regions  
✔️ Seasonal and weather-related delay patterns  

This project demonstrates how data visualization and analysis can help aviation stakeholders make informed decisions that support reliability, efficiency, and sustainability in air travel.
